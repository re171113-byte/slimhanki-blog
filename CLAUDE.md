## Article Writing Guidelines

### Magazine Style Rules

#### 1. Opening Hook (The Scene)
Never start with "Today we'll learn about..."

**DO THIS:**
```
It's late. The clock reads 2:47 AM, and you're four episodes deep
into Crash Landing on You. Your eyes are tired, but you can't stop.

Then it happens.

Captain Ri stands in his modest kitchen, steam rising from a
battered aluminum pot. He cracks an egg into bubbling broth...
```

**NOT THIS:**
```
Today we're going to learn how to make ramyeon from the popular
Korean drama Crash Landing on You. This recipe is simple and
delicious...
```

#### 2. Cultural Context Section
After the hook, explain WHY this food matters:
- What does it mean in Korean culture?
- Why did the drama use this food in this scene?
- What emotions does it evoke?

#### 3. Recipe Section
Clear, practical instructions:
- Ingredient list with alternatives
- Step-by-step with timing
- Pro tips from Korean home cooks
- Common mistakes to avoid

#### 4. The Epilogue
End with emotion, not "enjoy your meal":
```
It's now 3:15 AM. Your pot is empty, the broth drunk down to the
last drop. Tomorrow, you might try something elaborate. But tonight,
you made ramyeon. And that was exactly enough.
```

*This recipe is part of our K-Drama Kitchen series...*
```

### Markdown Formatting Rules

#### Italic Text (Emphasis)
Use `*text*` for:
- **Drama titles**: *Crash Landing on You*, *Goblin*, *Vincenzo*
- **Korean words**: *ramyeon*, *ttukbaegi*, *meokgo gallae*
- **Foreign terms**: *al dente*, *mise en place*

```markdown
You're four episodes deep into *Crash Landing on You*.
Use a traditional Korean *ttukbaegi* (earthenware pot).
```

#### Image Captions
Place caption **immediately after** the image on the same line or next line:

```markdown
![Korean Ramyeon in Traditional Pot](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?w=800)
*A steaming bowl of Korean ramyeon - where comfort meets culture*
```

This renders as a centered, gray caption below the image.

#### Character Notes
For in-character tips, use italics in a separate paragraph:

```markdown
*Captain Ri's Note: In North Korea, resources are scarce. Every drop of water matters.*
```

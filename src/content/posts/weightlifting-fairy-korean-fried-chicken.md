## The Scene: Athletes Breaking Their Diet

In *Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-joo* (역도요정 김복주, 2016), food plays a constant role in the story of young athletes balancing discipline with the simple pleasures of being twenty-something. Kim Bok-joo, played by Lee Sung-kyung, is a college weightlifter who must carefully manage her weight for competitions—but that doesn't stop her from craving chimaek (치맥, fried chicken and beer).

Throughout the drama, Bok-joo and her friends are shown indulging in late-night chicken deliveries, sneaking food between training sessions, and bonding over shared meals. The tension between athletic discipline and youthful cravings is central to the show's charm.

One of the drama's running themes is how food becomes an act of rebellion and connection. When Bok-joo shares chicken with Jung Joon-hyung (Nam Joo-hyuk), it's not just about eating—it's about choosing joy over strict regimen, choosing friendship over isolation.

Fun fact: Kim Bok-joo's character is loosely based on real-life Olympic weightlifter Jang Mi-ran, who won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

## The History of Korean Fried Chicken

### From American Influence to Korean Innovation

Korean fried chicken has a fascinating evolution:

**1950s: The Introduction**
Fried chicken was introduced to Korea by American military during the Korean War (1950-1953). American soldiers brought the concept, and it slowly entered Korean cuisine.

**1970s: Street Food Era**
In the 1970s, fried chicken began appearing as affordable street food, often sold as simple deep-fried pieces. The "tongdak" (whole fried chicken) became popular in small shops.

**Early 1980s: Yangnyeom Revolution**
The early 1980s saw the birth of *yangnyeom chicken*—fried chicken coated in a sweet-spicy sauce. This Korean innovation transformed plain fried chicken into something distinctly Korean.

**2002: Chimaek Goes Mainstream**
The term "chimaek" (치맥 = 치킨 + 맥주, chicken + beer) was coined during the 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup. As Koreans gathered to watch matches, fried chicken and beer became the official pairing. The combination exploded into a cultural phenomenon.

**2010s-Present: Global Expansion**
Korean fried chicken franchises like Kyochon, BBQ Chicken, and Bonchon expanded internationally, bringing the double-fry technique and distinctive sauces to the world.

### What Makes Korean Fried Chicken Different?

| Feature | Korean Style | American Style |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Coating | Thin, starch-based (potato/rice flour) | Thick, flour-based breading |
| Technique | Double-fried | Single-fried |
| Texture | Glass-like crunch | Craggly, substantial crust |
| Sauce | Glazed after frying (yangnyeom, soy-garlic) | Seasoned before/during frying |
| Eating time | Immediate (stays crispy ~20 min) | Can sit longer |

## The Recipe: Double-Fried Korean Chicken

### Ingredients

**For the Chicken**
- 1 kg chicken wings or drumettes (about 2 lbs)
- 1 cup potato starch (or cornstarch)
- ½ cup rice flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- 1 cup cold water
- Oil for deep frying

**Yangnyeom Sauce (Sweet-Spicy)**
- 3 tablespoons gochujang
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

**Soy-Garlic Sauce**
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

**Garnish**
- Sesame seeds
- Green onions
- Pickled radish (chicken mu)

### Equipment
- Deep pot or Dutch oven
- Cooking thermometer
- Wire rack
- Tongs

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prep Chicken**
Pat chicken pieces completely dry with paper towels. Moisture is the enemy of crispy skin. Let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.

**Step 2: Make Batter**
Whisk together potato starch, rice flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Add cold water gradually until batter reaches the consistency of heavy cream.

**Step 3: First Fry (160°C/320°F)**
Heat oil to 160°C (320°F). Dip chicken in batter, let excess drip off, and fry in batches for 10-12 minutes until cooked through and light golden. Transfer to wire rack.

**Step 4: Rest (5-10 minutes)**
Let chicken rest at room temperature. This crucial step allows moisture to redistribute for the perfect second fry.

**Step 5: Make Sauce**
While resting, combine sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Heat over medium until sugar dissolves and sauce thickens slightly.

**Step 6: Second Fry (180°C/350°F)**
Increase oil to 180°C (350°F). Fry chicken again for 3-4 minutes until deeply golden and crackling crispy.

**Step 7: Sauce and Serve**
For yangnyeom or soy-garlic style: Toss hot chicken immediately in warm sauce. For plain (*huraideu*): Season with fine salt. Serve immediately with pickled radish.

## FAQ

### What is chimaek?

Chimaek (치맥) is a Korean portmanteau combining *chikin* (치킨, fried chicken) and *maekju* (맥주, beer). It refers to the beloved pairing of Korean fried chicken with cold beer, especially popular as late-night food (*yashik*). The term became widespread during the 2002 World Cup.

### Why do Koreans double-fry their chicken?

The double-fry technique removes more moisture and creates a thinner, crispier coating. The first fry cooks the chicken through; the second fry at higher temperature creates the signature glass-like crunch that Korean fried chicken is famous for.

### What's the difference between yangnyeom and huraideu chicken?

*Huraideu* (후라이드) is plain fried chicken seasoned only with salt—preferred by purists. *Yangnyeom* (양념) is fried chicken glazed with sweet-spicy gochujang sauce. Most Korean chicken shops offer *banban* (반반, half-half) so you can have both.

### Why doesn't Korean fried chicken stay crispy like American fried chicken?

Korean fried chicken uses a thinner coating that stays crispy for about 20-30 minutes before softening. This is why Korean chicken shops fry to order and delivery is timed carefully. The trade-off for that glass-like crunch is a shorter window of optimal eating.

### What beer pairs best with Korean fried chicken?

Traditionally, Korean lagers like Cass, Hite, or Terra. These light, crisp beers are designed to cut through rich, fried food. The pairing is about refreshment and temperature contrast rather than complex flavor matching.

### Can I use an air fryer?

You can achieve decent crispiness, but the results won't match traditional double-frying. The characteristic Korean fried chicken crunch requires oil immersion. Air fryers work better for reheating than initial cooking.

### What is the real "Korean Fried Chicken" or KFC?

Koreans jokingly call their fried chicken "KFC" (Korean Fried Chicken) to distinguish it from the American fast-food chain. Unlike KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), Korean-style uses the double-fry technique and typically offers sauce-glazed varieties.

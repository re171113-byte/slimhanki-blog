## The Drama: Vincenzo's Unexpected Comfort

He's a cold-blooded Italian mafia consigliere. He's orchestrated deals worth billions, navigated the treacherous waters of the Cassano family, and returned to Korea with vengeance in his heart. But there's one thing that can make Vincenzo Cassano—played by Song Joong-ki with devastating charm—drop his guard.

Korean comfort food.

*Vincenzo* (빈센조) aired on tvN from February to May 2021, becoming one of the most-watched K-Dramas of the year. The series follows Park Joo-hyung, adopted by an Italian family and raised as Vincenzo Cassano, who returns to Seoul to retrieve gold hidden beneath a building occupied by quirky tenants. What starts as a simple extraction mission becomes a war against corrupt conglomerates—and an unexpected rediscovery of his Korean roots.

Throughout the drama, food becomes a recurring symbol of Vincenzo's internal conflict. Despite his refined Italian palate and love for wine, he finds himself repeatedly drawn to the simple Korean dishes of his childhood. The corn salad—a sweet, creamy Korean-style side dish—represents everything he left behind: unpretentious, communal, and deeply satisfying.

When a dangerous mafia lawyer sits down with the eccentric Geumga Plaza residents to share corn salad, you know something inside him has shifted.

## The History of Korean Corn Salad

### What Is Korean Corn Salad?

**Korean corn salad** (콘 샐러드 or 옥수수 샐러드) is not your typical green salad. It's a creamy, sweet side dish that combines:

- **Sweet corn kernels** as the base
- **Mayonnaise** for creaminess
- **Sugar** for that distinctly Korean sweet edge
- **Various additions** like cucumber, cabbage, or carrots

The result is more akin to a Western coleslaw in texture but with a flavor profile that's uniquely Korean—sweeter, creamier, and designed to complement spicy main dishes.

### Origins: East Meets West

Korean corn salad emerged in the late 20th century as Korea's food culture increasingly incorporated Western influences. The dish represents the Korean approach to foreign foods: take the concept, but make it your own.

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1970s-80s | Mayonnaise becomes popular in Korea |
| 1980s-90s | Western-style salads appear in Korean restaurants |
| 1990s-2000s | Corn salad becomes standard Korean restaurant banchan |
| 2010s-Present | Home recipes proliferate, variations multiply |
| 2021 | *Vincenzo* brings renewed attention to Korean comfort foods |

Unlike Western corn salads that might use vinaigrette or lighter dressings, Korean corn salad embraces the creamy, sweet profile that Koreans love. It's often served as *banchan* (side dish) at Korean BBQ restaurants, where its sweetness provides contrast to grilled meats.

### Why Koreans Love It

Several factors make corn salad a beloved Korean dish:

**1. The Sweet Tooth**
Korean cuisine has a notable sweet element that surprises many foreigners. From sweet soy sauce marinades to honey-drizzled fried chicken, Koreans appreciate sweetness in savory contexts. Corn salad fits perfectly into this preference.

**2. The Communal Aspect**
Like all *banchan*, corn salad is meant to be shared. It arrives in a small dish at the center of the table, and everyone takes a bit with their meal. For Vincenzo, sharing such dishes with the Geumga Plaza residents symbolizes his reluctant acceptance into their chaotic family.

**3. The Comfort Factor**
There's something deeply comforting about the combination of sweet corn and creamy mayonnaise. It's familiar, it's easy, and it reminds many Koreans of childhood meals at family restaurants.

## The Recipe: Korean Corn Salad

### Ingredients

**Essential**
- 2 cups sweet corn kernels (canned, frozen, or fresh)
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Pinch of salt

**Optional Additions**
- 1/4 cup diced cucumber
- 1/4 cup finely shredded cabbage
- 2 tablespoons diced carrot
- 1 tablespoon diced onion
- 1 hard-boiled egg, diced
- Parsley for garnish

**Variation: Creamy Style**
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream or condensed milk
- Additional mayonnaise to taste

### Equipment
- Mixing bowl
- Strainer (for canned corn)
- Spoon or spatula for mixing

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Corn**
If using canned corn, drain thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Excess moisture will make the salad watery. If using frozen corn, thaw completely and drain. Fresh corn should be boiled until tender, then cooled.

**Step 2: Mix the Base**
In a mixing bowl, combine mayonnaise, sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar dissolves into the mayonnaise. Taste and adjust sweetness—Korean corn salad is noticeably sweet, so don't be shy with the sugar.

**Step 3: Add the Corn**
Add the drained corn to the mayonnaise mixture. Fold gently to coat every kernel without mashing. The corn should remain whole and distinct.

**Step 4: Add Optional Ingredients**
If using vegetables, add them now and fold in gently. Cucumber adds freshness, cabbage adds crunch, and carrots add color. Don't overmix—you want to maintain texture.

**Step 5: Chill and Serve**
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows flavors to meld and the salad to firm up slightly. Serve cold as a side dish alongside Korean BBQ, fried chicken, or any main dish.

**Step 6: Garnish (Optional)**
Top with a sprinkle of parsley or a few reserved corn kernels for presentation.

## FAQ

### Why is Korean corn salad so sweet?

Korean cuisine generally embraces sweet flavors more than many Western cuisines. The sweetness in corn salad balances spicy main dishes and complements the natural sweetness of good corn. If it's too sweet for your taste, simply reduce the sugar gradually until you find your preference.

### Can I use fresh corn instead of canned?

Absolutely. Fresh corn on the cob, boiled until tender and then cut from the cob, makes an excellent corn salad. The flavor is often superior to canned. Just make sure to cool the corn completely before mixing with mayonnaise.

### How long does Korean corn salad last?

Properly stored in an airtight container, corn salad keeps for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. However, it's best eaten within 24 hours, as the vegetables may release water over time and the texture becomes less crisp.

### What's the best mayonnaise to use?

Korean brands like Ottogi or Kewpie (Japanese, but popular in Korea) are ideal. They tend to be slightly sweeter and creamier than American mayonnaise. If using American mayo like Hellmann's, you may want to add a touch more sugar.

### Is this the same as the corn salad at Korean BBQ restaurants?

Yes, this is essentially the same dish. Korean BBQ restaurants serve it as *banchan*, and the basic recipe is remarkably consistent: corn, mayo, and sugar. Some restaurants add vegetables or use their own secret ratios, but the foundation is the same.

### Can I make this vegan?

Yes. Substitute the mayonnaise with vegan mayo (many Korean stores carry it) and you'll have a vegan-friendly version. The taste is remarkably similar, as the sweetness and creaminess carry the dish.

### Why do people sometimes add condensed milk?

For an extra creamy, sweet version, some recipes add condensed milk. This creates a richer, almost dessert-like corn salad. It's not traditional, but it's popular for those who really want to lean into the sweet side.

## Make It Tonight

There's something beautifully ironic about a mafia consigliere finding peace in a bowl of corn salad. Vincenzo Cassano, who dined in the finest Italian restaurants and tasted wines that cost more than most people's monthly rent, ultimately finds comfort in the simplest Korean dishes.

Maybe that's the point. Food isn't about sophistication—it's about connection. When Vincenzo shares *banchan* with the chaotic residents of Geumga Plaza, he's not just eating. He's remembering who he was before Italy, before the Cassano family, before he learned to be cold.

You don't need to be a reformed mafia lawyer to appreciate a good corn salad. You just need corn, mayo, sugar, and maybe a few episodes of *Vincenzo* playing in the background.

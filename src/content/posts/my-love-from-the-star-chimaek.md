## The Drama: My Love from the Star's Snowy Craving

December 2013. Snow falls softly over Seoul as Cheon Song-yi—Korea's most famous actress, played by the incomparable Jun Ji-hyun—stands on her balcony. She's drunk, she's emotional, and she has exactly one thing on her mind.

"On a snowy day like this," she declares to no one in particular, "you have to eat chicken and beer. *Chimaek*."

That single line, delivered with Jun Ji-hyun's signature blend of comedy and vulnerability, triggered a phenomenon no one could have predicted. Within weeks of the episode airing, Korean fried chicken sales across Asia exploded. Chinese imports of Korean beer skyrocketed. And a simple portmanteau—*chimaek* (치맥), from *chicken* and *maekju* (맥주, beer)—became an international symbol of Korean comfort food culture.

*My Love from the Star* (별에서 온 그대) told the story of Do Min-joon, an alien who landed in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty and has been living among humans for 400 years. When he meets his neighbor, the eccentric top actress Cheon Song-yi, his carefully maintained distance from humanity begins to crumble. It's a love story wrapped in comedy, fantasy, and—crucially—food.

## The History of Chimaek

### What Is Chimaek?

**Chimaek** (치맥) is a Korean portmanteau combining:
- **Chi** (치) = Chicken (*chikin*, 치킨)
- **Maek** (맥) = Beer (*maekju*, 맥주)

But chimaek is more than just chicken and beer. It's a cultural institution—a way of eating, drinking, and bonding that defines Korean nightlife and social culture.

### Origins: American Roots, Korean Soul

Korean fried chicken traces its origins to the 1960s, when American-style fried chicken arrived with U.S. military presence. But Koreans didn't just adopt the dish—they transformed it.

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1960s | American fried chicken introduced |
| 1970s | First Korean chicken restaurants open |
| 1980s | Double-frying technique perfected |
| 1990s | *Yangnyeom* (sweet-spicy sauce) chicken invented |
| 2000s | Chimaek culture explodes with delivery apps |
| 2014 | *My Love from the Star* makes chimaek global |

The key innovation was **double-frying**. Unlike American fried chicken, which is fried once, Korean fried chicken is fried twice—first at a lower temperature to cook through, then at a higher temperature to create an impossibly thin, shatteringly crispy crust that stays crunchy even when sauced.

### The Chimaek Culture

In Korea, chimaek isn't just food—it's an experience. Here's how it works:

**The Setting**: *Hof* (호프) bars, outdoor *pojangmacha* tents, or at home via delivery

**The Order**: Fried chicken (various styles) + Korean beer or soju

**The Sides**: Pickled radish (*chicken mu*), coleslaw, beer

**The Occasion**: After work, during sports games, rainy days, snowy days, or any day really

The phrase "치킨은 살 안 쪄" ("Chicken doesn't make you fat")—another famous Cheon Song-yi line—became a joke mantra for chimaek lovers everywhere.

### Why Snowy Days?

Cheon Song-yi's insistence on eating chimaek during snowfall isn't random. In Korean culture, certain foods are associated with weather:

- **Rainy days** → *Pajeon* (scallion pancakes) and *makgeolli*
- **Snowy days** → Chimaek
- **Hot summer days** → Cold noodles (*naengmyeon*)

The crispy warmth of fried chicken contrasts perfectly with cold, quiet snowfall. It's comfort in its purest form.

## The Recipe: Authentic Korean Fried Chicken

### Ingredients

**For the Chicken**
- 1 kg chicken wings or drumettes
- 1 cup potato starch or cornstarch
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 cup cold water (or cold sparkling water for extra crispiness)
- Vegetable oil for deep frying

**For Yangnyeom Sauce (Sweet-Spicy)**
- 3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons honey or corn syrup
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

**For Soy Garlic Sauce**
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds

### Equipment
- Deep pot or fryer
- Cooking thermometer
- Wire rack
- Mixing bowls

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Chicken**
Pat chicken pieces completely dry with paper towels. This is crucial for crispy skin. Season lightly with salt and let rest for 15 minutes.

**Step 2: Make the Batter**
Mix potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add cold water and whisk until smooth but slightly thick. The batter should coat the chicken thinly.

**Step 3: First Fry (Low Temperature)**
Heat oil to 160°C (320°F). Dip chicken in batter, letting excess drip off. Fry in batches for 8-10 minutes until cooked through but still pale. Remove and rest on a wire rack for 10 minutes.

**Step 4: Second Fry (High Temperature)**
Heat oil to 180°C (350°F). Fry the chicken again for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and extra crispy. The double-fry creates that signature Korean fried chicken crunch.

**Step 5: Make Your Sauce**
While chicken rests, prepare your sauce of choice:
- **Yangnyeom**: Combine all ingredients in a pan, heat until bubbling
- **Soy Garlic**: Melt butter, add garlic, then remaining ingredients

**Step 6: Toss and Serve**
Toss hot chicken in sauce immediately, or serve sauce on the side for dipping. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with pickled radish and cold beer.

## FAQ

### What makes Korean fried chicken different from American fried chicken?

The double-frying technique. American fried chicken is typically fried once with a thick, flour-based breading. Korean fried chicken uses a thinner, starch-based coating and is fried twice, resulting in an incredibly thin, crispy shell that stays crunchy much longer—even under sauce.

### What beer goes best with chimaek?

Traditionally, Korean beers like Cass, Hite, or Terra are the go-to choices. They're light, crisp, and designed to complement fried food. Some prefer soju mixed with beer (*somaek*). For international options, any light lager works well.

### Can I make the chicken less spicy?

Yes. For non-spicy options, skip the yangnyeom sauce and go with soy garlic, honey butter, or simply serve with salt. You can also reduce the gochujang in yangnyeom sauce or substitute with tomato paste.

### Why does Korean fried chicken stay crispy under sauce?

The double-frying removes more moisture from the skin and creates a denser crust. The thin, starch-based coating also absorbs less oil and sauce than flour-heavy batters. This is the secret to enjoying sauced chicken that doesn't get soggy.

### Did chimaek really become popular because of My Love from the Star?

Yes. While chimaek culture existed before the drama, the show's popularity—especially in China—caused a documented surge in Korean fried chicken exports and restaurant openings. The "snowy day = chimaek" association became firmly embedded in pop culture.

### Can I bake instead of fry?

You can air-fry at 200°C for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway. Results won't be quite as crispy as double-frying, but it's a healthier alternative. Traditional oven baking tends to yield less satisfying results.

### What are the most popular chimaek styles?

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Original (*huraideu*) | Classic crispy, unsauced |
| Yangnyeom | Sweet and spicy red sauce |
| Soy Garlic | Sweet, savory, garlicky |
| Honey Butter | Sweet and buttery |
| Snow Cheese | Powdered cheese coating |
| Half-Half | Two flavors on one platter |

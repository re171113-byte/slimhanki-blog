## The Scene: Episode 4 - A Bowl of Trust

In Episode 4 of *Crash Landing on You* (사랑의 불시착), one of the most memorable food scenes in K-Drama history unfolds. Captain Ri Jeong-hyuk stands in his modest North Korean kitchen, cooking ramyeon for Yoon Se-ri, a South Korean heiress who has crash-landed into his life—literally.

The scene is deceptively simple: steam rises from an aluminum pot, an egg cracks into bubbling broth, and two people from opposite worlds share a late-night meal. Yet this moment resonated with millions of viewers worldwide, turning a packet of instant noodles into a symbol of unexpected connection.

What makes this scene so powerful isn't the food itself—it's what it represents. In Korean culture, the phrase "라면 먹고 갈래?" (*ramyeon meokgo gallae?*—"Do you want to come in for ramyeon?") carries romantic undertones, similar to the Western "Would you like to come up for coffee?" When Ri Jeong-hyuk offers Se-ri ramyeon, he's offering more than noodles. He's offering trust, vulnerability, and a moment of warmth in an impossible situation.

## The History of Korean Ramyeon

Korean ramyeon has a fascinating origin story that begins in post-war Korea.

### 1963: The Birth of Korean Instant Noodles

In 1963, Samyang Foods introduced Korea's first instant ramyeon, adapting technology from Japan's Myojo Foods. At a time when Korea was still recovering from the Korean War and rice was scarce, instant noodles provided an affordable, filling alternative. The first Samyang Ramyeon cost just 10 won—about the price of a bus ticket.

### From Survival Food to Cultural Icon

What started as a practical solution to food scarcity evolved into something deeply embedded in Korean culture:

- **1970s-80s**: Ramyeon became a staple for students and workers, synonymous with late-night studying and overtime work
- **1986**: Nongshim launched Shin Ramyun, which would become Korea's most iconic spicy instant noodle
- **1990s-2000s**: K-Dramas began featuring ramyeon scenes, cementing its romantic and nostalgic associations
- **2019-2020**: *Crash Landing on You* sparked a global ramyeon craze, with international viewers recreating the Episode 4 scene

### Why Koreans Eat Ramyeon Differently

Unlike instant noodles in other countries, Korean ramyeon has its own eating culture:

| Tradition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Eating from the pot | Intimacy and informality—you only do this with close people |
| Adding a raw egg | Personal care—"I made this special for you" |
| Eating at convenience stores | Quick comfort—microwave ramyeon stations are everywhere in Korea |
| Late-night ramyeon | Shared exhaustion—a bonding ritual after long days |

## The Recipe: Ri Jeong-hyuk's Ramyeon

This recipe recreates the simple, comforting ramyeon from the *Crash Landing on You* scene—no fancy additions, just the essentials done right.

### Ingredients

**Essential**
- 1 pack Korean ramyeon (Shin Ramyun or Jin Ramen recommended)
- 550ml water
- 1 fresh egg
- 2 stalks green onion, chopped

**Optional**
- 1 slice American cheese
- Kimchi (2-3 tablespoons)

### Equipment
- Small pot or Korean *yangeuun naembi* (aluminum pot)
- Lid
- Chopsticks
- Trivet or heat-safe surface

### Instructions

**Step 1: Boil the Water**
Bring 550ml of water to a rolling boil over high heat. The extra 50ml (compared to package directions) accounts for evaporation and gives you more broth to enjoy at the end.

**Step 2: Add Soup Base**
Once boiling, add the soup powder and dried vegetable flakes. Stir briefly to dissolve.

**Step 3: Cook the Noodles**
Add the noodle block. Let it soften for 30 seconds before gently loosening with chopsticks. Cook for 3 minutes total.

**Step 4: Add the Egg**
At the 2-minute mark, reduce heat to medium. Push noodles aside to create a well in the center. Crack the egg directly into this space. **Do not stir.** Cover with a lid and let the egg poach for 60 seconds. The goal: set whites, runny yolk.

**Step 5: Finish and Serve**
Remove from heat. Add chopped green onions. If using cheese, lay it over the noodles to melt from residual heat.

**Important**: Do not transfer to a bowl. Eat directly from the pot—this is the Korean way.

## FAQ

### What brand of ramyeon was used in Crash Landing on You?

The show doesn't explicitly name the brand, but based on the packaging and noodle style, it appears to be either **Shin Ramyun** (spicier) or **Jin Ramen** (milder). Both are widely available internationally at Korean grocery stores or online retailers like Amazon and H Mart.

### What does "라면 먹고 갈래?" (ramyeon meokgo gallae) mean?

Literally, it translates to "Do you want to eat ramyeon before you go?" However, in Korean culture and K-Dramas, this phrase carries romantic implications—similar to asking someone to "come up for coffee" in Western contexts. It's an invitation to spend more time together in an intimate setting.

### Why do Koreans eat ramyeon from the pot?

Three reasons: (1) The pot keeps noodles hot longer than a bowl, (2) it creates a sense of informality and closeness—you wouldn't eat from a pot with strangers, and (3) fewer dishes to wash. In K-Dramas, pot-sharing often symbolizes growing intimacy between characters.

### How do I get the perfect egg in ramyeon?

The key is timing and temperature. Reduce heat before adding the egg, don't stir after cracking it in, and use a lid to create steam that cooks the top while keeping the yolk runny. Total egg cooking time should be about 60 seconds after covering.

### Can I make this recipe less spicy?

Yes. Use only half the soup powder, or choose Jin Ramen (mild version) instead of Shin Ramyun. Adding a slice of American cheese also mellows the heat while adding creaminess.

### What makes Korean ramyeon different from Japanese ramen?

Korean ramyeon is instant (quick-cooking dried noodles with powdered soup), while Japanese ramen typically refers to fresh noodles in slow-cooked broth. Korean ramyeon is also generally spicier and has chewier noodles. The cultural context differs too—ramyeon is casual comfort food, while ramen can be a craft cuisine.

### When did ramyeon become popular in Korea?

Samyang Foods introduced Korea's first instant ramyeon in 1963, adapting Japanese technology. It gained popularity as an affordable meal during Korea's economic development period. By the 1980s, brands like Nongshim (Shin Ramyun, 1986) had made it a household staple.

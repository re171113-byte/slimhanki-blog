## The Drama: Itaewon Class and Street Food Dreams

*Itaewon Class* (이태원 클라쓰, 2020) starring Park Seo-joon as Park Sae-royi tells the story of a determined young man who opens a small bar-restaurant called DanBam (단밤, "Sweet Night") in Itaewon after his father's tragic death.

The drama celebrates Korean entrepreneurial spirit and the food service industry. While DanBam serves various bar foods, the show's setting in Itaewon—Seoul's most diverse neighborhood—perfectly captures the vibrant Korean street food culture where **tteokbokki** (떡볶이) reigns supreme.

Tteokbokki is everywhere in Seoul: at pojangmacha (street food tents), in school zones, at train stations, and in convenience stores. It's what students eat after hagwon (cram school), what office workers crave at midnight, and what entrepreneurs serve when they're chasing their dreams.

## The History of Tteokbokki

### Origins: Royal Court Tteokbokki (Gungjung Tteokbokki)

The earliest tteokbokki wasn't the fiery red dish we know today. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), **Gungjung Tteokbokki** (궁중 떡볶이) was a royal court dish seasoned with soy sauce, not gochujang.

This original version combined rice cakes with beef, vegetables, and a savory soy-based sauce. It was elegant, mild, and reserved for the aristocracy—a far cry from the street food beloved by millions today.

### The 1953 Revolution: Ma Bok-rim's Invention

The modern spicy tteokbokki we crave was born in 1953 in **Sindang-dong**, Seoul. According to food historians, a woman named **Ma Bok-rim** (마복림) accidentally dropped rice cakes into gochujang sauce and discovered a delicious combination.

She began selling this new spicy version from a small stall, and it quickly became popular. Her invention spread across Seoul, transforming tteokbokki from royal court delicacy to democratic street food.

Today, Sindang-dong's "Tteokbokki Town" (떡볶이 타운) remains a pilgrimage site for tteokbokki lovers, with dozens of restaurants carrying on Ma Bok-rim's legacy.

### The Evolution

| Era | Style | Characteristics |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| Joseon Dynasty | Gungjung (Royal) | Soy sauce, beef, mild |
| 1953 | Ma Bok-rim's original | Gochujang, simple, spicy |
| 1970s-80s | Street food boom | Fish cakes added, standardized |
| 2000s-Present | Fusion varieties | Cheese, carbonara, jjajang versions |

## The Recipe: Traditional Tteokbokki

### Ingredients

**Essential**
- 500g Korean rice cakes (*garae-tteok*), cylindrical
- 3 cups anchovy-kelp broth (or water + dashi)
- 2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar (or Korean corn syrup)
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic

**Traditional Additions**
- 150g Korean fish cakes (*eomuk*), sliced
- 2 hard-boiled eggs
- 2 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
- ¼ cabbage, roughly chopped (optional)

### Equipment
- Wide, shallow pan or pot
- Wooden spoon

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare Rice Cakes**
If frozen, soak rice cakes in warm water for 20-30 minutes until softened. Fresh rice cakes can be used directly. Quality matters—cheap ones turn mushy.

**Step 2: Make Broth (Optional but Recommended)**
Simmer 3 cups water with dried anchovies (head and guts removed) and kelp for 10 minutes. Remove solids. This adds depth that water alone can't provide.

**Step 3: Mix Sauce**
Combine gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, and garlic in a small bowl. Mix until smooth.

**Step 4: Cook**
Pour broth into a wide pan over medium-high heat. Add sauce mixture and stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil.

Add in order:
1. Rice cakes (need most time)
2. Fish cakes
3. Cabbage (if using)

**Step 5: Simmer**
Reduce heat to medium. Cook 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently. The rice cakes will absorb sauce and the liquid will reduce to a glossy coating.

**Step 6: Finish**
When rice cakes are soft and chewy (not mushy), add green onions. Stir 30 seconds more. Add hard-boiled eggs. Serve immediately.

## FAQ

### What does tteokbokki taste like?

Sweet, spicy, and deeply savory. The rice cakes are neutral and chewy—almost bouncy. The sauce does all the flavor work, coating each piece in a glossy, addictive red glaze.

### Is tteokbokki very spicy?

By Korean standards, moderately spicy. For Western palates, it can be quite hot. Control heat by adjusting gochugaru amount—start with half if sensitive to spice.

### What are Korean rice cakes made of?

Traditional *garae-tteok* is made from glutinous rice flour and water, steamed and extruded into cylindrical shapes. The uniquely chewy texture has no Western equivalent.

### Why did my rice cakes turn hard?

They've been overcooked then cooled, or were poor quality. Fresh or properly thawed rice cakes stay chewy while hot. Always eat tteokbokki immediately.

### What's the difference between tteokbokki and rabokki?

Rabokki (라볶이) adds instant ramyeon noodles to tteokbokki. This modern fusion is incredibly popular—the noodles absorb sauce differently than rice cakes.

### Can I make tteokbokki vegetarian?

Yes. Skip fish cakes and use vegetable broth. Check gochujang labels—some contain anchovy. The dish is equally delicious without animal products.

### What is gungjung tteokbokki?

The original royal court version from Joseon Dynasty. It uses soy sauce instead of gochujang, includes beef and vegetables, and has a mild, savory flavor—nothing like the spicy street version.

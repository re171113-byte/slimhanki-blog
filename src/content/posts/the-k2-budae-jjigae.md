## The Perfect Pairing: Action Dramas and Survival Food

Action K-dramas like *The K2* (더 케이투, 2016) understand something essential: warriors need sustenance. Ji Chang-wook's character Kim Je-ha—a former soldier turned bodyguard navigating Seoul's dangerous underworld—embodies the kind of gritty survival that makes budae jjigae (부대찌개) the perfect companion dish.

While you won't find a specific budae jjigae scene in *The K2*, the drama's themes of survival, military background, and finding comfort in harsh circumstances perfectly match the origin story of this iconic Korean dish.

Budae jjigae, literally "army base stew," was born from war. It's a dish that shouldn't exist—American processed meats swimming in Korean spicy broth—yet has become one of Korea's most beloved comfort foods.

## The History of Budae Jjigae

### Born from Necessity: Post-Korean War Origins

After the Korean War (1950-1953), South Korea faced devastating food shortages. The country was economically devastated, and many Koreans struggled to feed their families.

Around U.S. military bases, particularly in Uijeongbu (의정부) north of Seoul, something unexpected happened. American surplus foods—Spam, hot dogs, canned baked beans, processed cheese—found their way outside the bases. Whether through official channels, black markets, or simple resourcefulness, these foreign ingredients reached Korean kitchens.

Local cooks, faced with alien ingredients and hungry stomachs, did what creative cooks always do: they adapted. They combined American processed meats with Korean staples—gochugaru (red pepper flakes), kimchi, tofu, and later ramyeon noodles—creating an entirely new dish.

### From Survival Food to National Treasure

What began as desperation cuisine in the 1950s-60s evolved through decades:

**1950s-60s**: The dish emerges around military bases, initially looked down upon as "poor people's food" made from scraps.

**1970s-80s**: As Korea's economy grew, budae jjigae transformed from survival food to nostalgic comfort food. Restaurants specializing in the dish opened, especially in Uijeongbu.

**1990s-Present**: Budae jjigae becomes a mainstream favorite. Uijeongbu's "Budae Jjigae Street" (부대찌개 거리) becomes a tourist destination. The dish appears in Korean media, representing both history and comfort.

Today, budae jjigae is served in restaurants worldwide, a testament to how necessity can birth deliciousness.

### The Uijeongbu Connection

Uijeongbu, located near the former U.S. military base Camp Casey, is considered the birthplace of budae jjigae. The city has embraced this identity, with an entire street of restaurants dedicated to the dish. Visiting Uijeongbu for budae jjigae is a pilgrimage for Korean food enthusiasts.

## The Recipe: Traditional Budae Jjigae

### Ingredients

**Proteins**
- 200g Spam, sliced
- 2 hot dogs or sausages, sliced diagonally
- 200g firm tofu, cubed
- 100g ground pork (optional)

**Vegetables & Fermented**
- 1 cup aged kimchi (묵은지), chopped
- 4 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
- ½ onion, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- Mushrooms (optional)

**Stew Base**
- 4 cups anchovy/kelp broth (or water with dashi)
- 2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar

**Finishers**
- 1 pack Korean ramyeon noodles
- 2 slices American cheese
- ½ cup canned baked beans (traditional)
- 1 egg (optional)

### Equipment
- Wide, shallow pot or Korean *jeongol* pan
- Portable burner for tableside cooking

### Instructions

**Step 1: Make Sauce**
Mix gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, and minced garlic in a small bowl. This concentrated paste is your flavor base.

**Step 2: Arrange Ingredients**
Place all solid ingredients in the pot in sections: Spam on one side, hot dogs next, tofu, kimchi, pork, vegetables. This visual arrangement is traditional and allows diners to choose from different sections.

**Step 3: Add Sauce and Broth**
Spoon sauce mixture over the center. Pour broth around the edges—enough to mostly cover but not submerge ingredients (about 3-4 cups).

**Step 4: Boil**
Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, covered. Cook 7-8 minutes until everything is heated through and flavors meld.

**Step 5: Add Noodles**
Add ramyeon noodles, pushing them into the broth. Add baked beans if using. Cook uncovered 3-4 minutes.

**Step 6: Finish**
Lay American cheese slices on top (don't stir—let them melt). Optionally crack an egg into the center. Serve immediately, keeping pot on low heat at the table.

## FAQ

### What does budae jjigae taste like?

A harmonious collision: spicy from gochugaru and gochujang, tangy from aged kimchi, salty from Spam and hot dogs, creamy from melted cheese. Every spoonful offers different combinations depending on what you scoop.

### Is budae jjigae really from the Korean War?

The dish emerged in the post-war period (1950s-60s) around U.S. military bases, particularly in Uijeongbu. While the exact origin is debated, its connection to American military surplus food is well documented historically.

### Why must it be Spam specifically?

Spam's unique combination of salt, fat, and texture is essential to the dish's flavor profile. It was what was available from American bases, and its specific taste became integral to budae jjigae. Other luncheon meats don't produce the same result.

### Why is American cheese used?

When budae jjigae evolved, processed American cheese was available from U.S. military bases. Its melting properties are perfect—it becomes creamy without separating. This isn't the place for artisan cheese.

### Is Uijeongbu worth visiting for budae jjigae?

If you're in Korea and love the dish, yes. "Budae Jjigae Street" in Uijeongbu has dozens of specialized restaurants, each with their own variation. It's a unique food pilgrimage that connects you to the dish's history.

### Can I make it less spicy?

Yes. Reduce the gochugaru and gochujang by half. The cheese also helps temper heat. Start mild—you can always add more spice.

### Why is it eaten communally from one pot?

Budae jjigae is traditionally a sharing dish. The pot sits on a burner at the table, and everyone eats directly from it. This communal style is part of Korean food culture, building connection through shared meals.

## The Scene: Parasite's Most Delicious Moment

In Bong Joon-ho's Academy Award-winning film *Parasite* (기생충, 2019), there's a pivotal scene that food lovers around the world couldn't forget. The wealthy Park family returns home unexpectedly from a rained-out camping trip. Mrs. Park calls ahead, asking her housekeeper to prepare "ram-don"—but with expensive *hanwoo* beef added.

"Ram-don with *hanwoo* beef," she says casually, as if combining instant noodles with premium Korean beef were the most natural thing in the world.

This brief cooking scene became one of the film's most memorable moments. While tension builds in the background (no spoilers), the simple act of mixing two instant noodle packages suddenly represents so much more: class division, the blending of cheap and expensive, the casual extravagance of the wealthy.

After *Parasite* won four Academy Awards including Best Picture, searches for "ram-don" and "jjapaguri" exploded globally. Korean grocery stores reported selling out of both Chapagetti and Neoguri. A humble dorm-room invention had become an international culinary sensation.

## The History of Jjapaguri

### What Is Jjapaguri?

Jjapaguri (짜파구리) is a Korean portmanteau combining two instant noodle brands:
- **Chapagetti** (짜파게티) - Black bean sauce noodles
- **Neoguri** (너구리) - Spicy seafood udon-style noodles

The name comes from combining "짜파게티" + "너구리" = "짜파구리." The English subtitle translation "ram-don" (ramen + udon) was created specifically for the *Parasite* film and isn't used in Korea.

### The Origins: 1980s Korea

The two noodles that make up jjapaguri have their own histories:

**Chapagetti (1984)**
Nongshim released Chapagetti on March 19, 1984. The name combines "짜장" (jjajang, black bean sauce) + "spaghetti." It was designed to mimic jjajangmyeon—the beloved Korean-Chinese black bean noodle dish—in instant form. Unlike most ramyeon, Chapagetti is a dry stir-fry style noodle with no soup.

**Neoguri (1982)**
Nongshim launched Neoguri in 1982. The name means "raccoon" in Korean (너구리), featuring the animal on its packaging. Its concept blends Korean ramyeon spiciness with Japanese udon thickness—featuring thick, chewy noodles in a spicy seafood broth flavored with kelp.

### From Student Hack to Global Fame

The practice of mixing Chapagetti and Neoguri began in Korean dormitories and military barracks, where young people experimented with combining instant noodles. The exact origin is unknown, but by the 2000s, jjapaguri was a well-known "ramyeon combination" in Korea.

Then came *Parasite*.

Bong Joon-ho's 2019 film transformed jjapaguri from a niche Korean comfort food into an international phenomenon. The scene's genius lies in what it represents: the wealthy Park family adds *hanwoo* beef (one of the most expensive meats in Korea) to what is essentially a ₩3,000 instant noodle dish. Luxury and simplicity, mixed together.

## The Recipe: Jjapaguri (Ram-don)

This recipe follows the traditional Korean method, with the option to add *hanwoo*-style beef for the full *Parasite* experience.

### Ingredients

**Essential**
- 1 pack Chapagetti (짜파게티)
- 1 pack Neoguri (너구리) - spicy version (빨간 너구리)
- 600ml water (about 2.5 cups)

**Parasite Upgrade**
- 150g beef sirloin or ribeye, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Optional**
- 1 egg
- Green onions, sliced
- Sesame seeds

### Equipment
- Medium pot
- Chopsticks
- Bowl for serving

### Instructions

**Step 1: Sear the Beef (Optional)**
If adding beef, heat oil in your pot over high heat. Season beef cubes with salt and pepper. Sear in a single layer without moving for 90 seconds until browned. Flip and repeat. Remove and set aside—don't wash the pot.

**Step 2: Boil Water**
Add 600ml water to the pot. Bring to a rolling boil. Use slightly less water than package directions suggest for a saucier result.

**Step 3: Cook Noodles**
Add both noodle blocks. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring to separate strands.

**Step 4: Add Sauce**
With 1 minute remaining:
- Add the full Chapagetti sauce packet (black bean) and oil packet
- Add only **HALF** the Neoguri soup powder
- Add the Neoguri vegetable flakes

Stir vigorously until noodles are evenly coated with glossy black sauce.

**Step 5: Combine**
Return seared beef to the pot. Toss everything together. If adding an egg, crack it in and stir quickly for a silkier sauce.

**Step 6: Serve Immediately**
Transfer to a bowl. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Eat immediately—jjapaguri doesn't wait.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between jjapaguri and ram-don?

They're the same dish. Jjapaguri (짜파구리) is the Korean name. "Ram-don" is the English subtitle translation created for *Parasite*, combining "ramen" and "udon." Koreans don't actually use the term "ram-don."

### Why use only half the Neoguri soup powder?

Using all of both seasoning packets makes the dish too salty. Korean home cooks developed the "half powder" rule through trial and error. The Chapagetti sauce provides enough flavor—you only need Neoguri's powder for its spicy seafood kick.

### Where can I buy Chapagetti and Neoguri?

Both are widely available at Asian grocery stores (H Mart, 99 Ranch, etc.) and online retailers like Amazon. Look for them in the Korean instant noodle section. Chapagetti has a black package; Neoguri has an orange package with a raccoon.

### What is hanwoo beef?

*Hanwoo* (한우) is Korean native cattle, considered one of the highest-quality and most expensive beef varieties in the world. In *Parasite*, the request to add hanwoo to instant noodles symbolizes the wealthy family's casual extravagance. You can substitute any quality beef sirloin or ribeye.

### Can I make jjapaguri without beef?

Absolutely. The beef addition is the "wealthy family version" from *Parasite*. Traditional jjapaguri is just the two noodles combined—no meat required. It's equally delicious and more affordable.

### Is jjapaguri spicy?

Moderately. Neoguri brings heat, but the black bean sauce mellows it. For less spice, use mild Neoguri (순한맛, green package) or reduce the soup powder amount further.

### How many calories are in jjapaguri?

Without beef: approximately 900-1000 calories for the full two-pack serving. With beef: add 200-300 calories. This is comfort food, not diet food.

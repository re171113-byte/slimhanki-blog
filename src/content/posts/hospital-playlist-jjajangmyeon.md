## The Drama: *Hospital Playlist* and the Power of Shared Meals

It's Thursday night at Yulje Medical Center.

Five doctors—exhausted from surgeries, consultations, and life-altering decisions—gather in a cramped office. Someone's already on the phone. *"Jjajangmyeon five, tangsuyuk one, jjamppong two..."*

This is *Hospital Playlist* (*슬기로운 의사생활*), and this is how friendship survives two decades.

In Shin Won-ho's beloved medical drama, food isn't background noise. It's the glue that holds five impossibly busy people together. And no food appears more often than jjajangmyeon—those glossy black bean noodles that arrive in white takeout containers, steaming and ready to be devoured between emergencies.

Lee Ik-jun slurps loudly. Ahn Jeong-won eats methodically. Kim Jun-wan complains about the wait. Yang Seok-hyung barely looks up from his phone. Chae Song-hwa finishes first, always.

Watching them eat, you understand something profound: the most meaningful meals aren't fancy. They're consistent. They're shared. They're jjajangmyeon at 10 PM with people who've known you since medical school.

## The History of Jjajangmyeon

### What Is Jjajangmyeon?

*Jjajangmyeon* (짜장면) translates literally to "fried sauce noodles." Thick wheat noodles are topped with a savory-sweet sauce made from *chunjang* (Korean black bean paste), diced pork, and vegetables—usually onions, zucchini, and potatoes. The dish is served with a side of pickled radish (*danmuji*) and often accompanied by raw onion slices in a sweet black vinegar sauce.

### From China to Korea: A Immigrant Story

Jjajangmyeon's origins trace back to 1905, when Chinese immigrants from Shandong province settled in Korea's port city of Incheon. They brought with them *zhájiàngmiàn* (炸酱面)—Beijing-style noodles with fermented soybean paste.

But Korean jjajangmyeon quickly evolved into something entirely different.

The Korean version uses *chunjang*, a sweeter and milder black bean paste, rather than the intensely salty Chinese *tianmianjiang*. Caramel was added for color and sweetness. The vegetables changed. The technique adapted.

| Feature | Chinese Zhájiàngmiàn | Korean Jjajangmyeon |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Sauce base | Fermented soybean | Sweet black bean (chunjang) |
| Flavor profile | Salty, earthy | Sweet, savory, caramelized |
| Vegetables | Cucumber, radish | Onion, zucchini, potato |
| Noodle type | Thin, hand-pulled | Thick, chewy wheat |
| Serving style | Mixed tableside | Pre-sauced or separate |

By the 1950s, jjajangmyeon had become Korea's first delivery food. Chinese restaurants—called *junghwayori-jip*—sent out armies of delivery men on motorcycles, metal containers stacked impossibly high. The sound of those motorcycles became the soundtrack of Korean childhood.

### Black Day and Cultural Significance

Korea's love for jjajangmyeon runs so deep that the country created a holiday around it.

April 14th is *Black Day* (블랙데이)—when single people who didn't receive gifts on Valentine's Day (February 14) or White Day (March 14) gather to eat jjajangmyeon together. The black sauce represents their state of solitary solidarity.

It's self-deprecating humor, Korean-style. And it's delicious.

## The Recipe: Classic Jjajangmyeon

### Ingredients

**Essential**
- 400g fresh jjajangmyeon noodles (or thick udon)
- 200g pork belly or shoulder, diced into 1cm cubes
- 4 tablespoons chunjang (Korean black bean paste)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 medium zucchini, diced
- 1 medium potato, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 cups water or pork/chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon potato starch + 2 tablespoons water (slurry)

**Optional**
- 1/2 cup diced cabbage
- Fresh cucumber, julienned (for garnish)
- Pickled radish (danmuji)
- Raw onion slices in black vinegar

### Equipment
- Large wok or deep frying pan
- Large pot for boiling noodles
- Cutting board and knife
- Measuring cups and spoons

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Chunjang**

Raw *chunjang* can taste bitter and raw. To mellow it out, fry the paste in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. The color will deepen and the aroma will become nuttier. Set aside.

**Step 2: Cook the Pork**

Heat the remaining oil in a wok over high heat. Add the diced pork and cook until browned on all sides, about 4-5 minutes. Don't move it too much—let it develop a crust.

**Step 3: Build the Sauce**

Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the onion, potato, and zucchini. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.

Add the fried chunjang and sugar. Stir everything together until the vegetables are coated in that gorgeous black sauce.

**Step 4: Simmer**

Pour in the water or stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened slightly.

**Step 5: Thicken**

Mix the potato starch with water to create a slurry. Slowly drizzle it into the sauce while stirring. The sauce should become glossy and coat a spoon. Adjust consistency as needed.

**Step 6: Cook the Noodles**

While the sauce simmers, cook the noodles according to package directions. Fresh jjajangmyeon noodles take about 4-5 minutes. Drain and rinse briefly under cold water to remove excess starch, then drain again.

**Step 7: Serve**

Place noodles in a bowl. Ladle the sauce generously over the top. Garnish with julienned cucumber if desired. Serve immediately with pickled radish on the side.

## FAQ

### Can I use instant jjajangmyeon instead?

Absolutely. Instant versions like Chapagetti are convenient and tasty. But homemade jjajangmyeon has a depth of flavor that packets can't match. If you're short on time, instant works. If you want the *Hospital Playlist* experience—the full ritual of delivery food—make it from scratch.

### What's the difference between jjajangmyeon and jjamppong?

*Jjajangmyeon* is black bean noodles—savory, sweet, and mild. *Jjamppong* is spicy seafood noodle soup—fiery red and intense. In Korean Chinese restaurants, ordering both and sharing is standard practice. One person gets black, one gets red.

### Is chunjang the same as Chinese black bean paste?

No. Korean *chunjang* is sweeter and milder than Chinese fermented black bean paste. Using Chinese paste will result in a saltier, more pungent dish. Look for Korean *chunjang* specifically—the package will have Korean writing and often shows a picture of jjajangmyeon.

### Can I make this vegetarian?

Yes! Replace pork with firm tofu or mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms add wonderful umami depth. The sauce itself is naturally vegetarian-friendly (just check that your chunjang doesn't contain shrimp paste).

### Why do Koreans eat jjajangmyeon on moving day?

Moving day in Korea (*isa*, 이사) traditionally requires feeding the moving crew. Jjajangmyeon is quick to order, easy to eat standing up, comes in disposable containers, and is universally loved. It became the default moving day meal decades ago and the tradition stuck.

### How do I store leftover sauce?

The sauce keeps refrigerated for 3-4 days. Don't mix it with noodles until serving—noodles will absorb all the liquid and become soggy. Reheat sauce gently with a splash of water if it's thickened too much.

### What does jjajangmyeon taste like?

Imagine caramelized onions meeting umami-rich soy sauce with a hint of sweetness. It's savory, slightly sweet, deeply satisfying—the kind of flavor that makes you understand why someone would order it twice a week for twenty years.

## Make It Tonight

There's a reason the five doctors of *Hospital Playlist* keep ordering jjajangmyeon.

It's not because it's fancy. It's not because it's healthy. It's because after a 12-hour shift of holding lives in your hands, sometimes you need food that asks nothing of you. Food that arrives hot, tastes familiar, and reminds you that the people across the table have been there since the beginning.

You probably don't have friends you've known for twenty years. Most of us don't. But you can still experience that particular comfort—the glossy black sauce, the chewy noodles, the satisfying slurp that signals the end of a long day.

Make jjajangmyeon tonight. Call someone you haven't talked to in too long. Eat together, even if it's over video call.

오늘 밤, *슬기로운 의사생활* 정주행하면서 직접 만든 짜장면과 함께하는 건 어떨까요?

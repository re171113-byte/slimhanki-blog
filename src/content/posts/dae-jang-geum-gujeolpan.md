## The Drama: Dae Jang Geum (2003-2004)

*Dae Jang Geum* (대장금), known internationally as *Jewel in the Palace*, aired on MBC from 2003 to 2004 and became one of the most influential K-dramas ever produced. Starring Lee Young-ae in the title role, the drama tells the story of Jang Geum—an orphaned kitchen maid who rises to become the first female royal physician in Joseon Dynasty history.

The drama is based on the real historical figure Jang Geum, mentioned in the *Annals of the Joseon Dynasty* as a medical woman who served King Jungjong in the 16th century.

What made *Dae Jang Geum* groundbreaking was its detailed portrayal of Korean royal court cuisine (*gungjung eumsik*). The drama featured countless cooking scenes showing traditional dishes prepared with precision and artistry, sparking worldwide interest in Korean food culture.

Among the many dishes featured, **gujeolpan** (구절판)—the nine-section platter—represents the pinnacle of royal Korean cuisine's visual and philosophical sophistication.

## The History of Gujeolpan

### Origins in the Joseon Dynasty

Gujeolpan dates back to 14th-century Korea during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). The name literally means:
- **Gu** (구) = Nine
- **Jeol** (절) = Section
- **Pan** (판) = Platter

Originally a royal court dish, gujeolpan was served during important celebrations, banquets, and holidays. Only the royal court had the resources—ingredients, skilled cooks, and time—to prepare such an elaborate dish.

### The Philosophy: Obangsaek (Five Traditional Colors)

Gujeolpan embodies **obangsaek** (오방색), the five traditional Korean colors rooted in Yin-Yang philosophy and the Five Elements theory:

| Color | Korean | Element | Direction | Health Benefit |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| White | 백 (baek) | Metal | West | Lung & bronchial health |
| Black | 흑 (heuk) | Water | North | Kidney function |
| Blue/Green | 청 (cheong) | Wood | East | Liver health |
| Red | 적 (jeok) | Fire | South | Heart & blood circulation |
| Yellow | 황 (hwang) | Earth | Center | Digestive system |

When eating gujeolpan, you're not just enjoying a meal—you're consuming cosmic balance, nourishing every organ system according to traditional Korean medicine.

### Structure of the Dish

Gujeolpan is served in a distinctive octagonal or round platter divided into nine sections:
- **Center**: *Miljeonbyeong* (밀전병)—thin wheat flour crepes
- **8 Surrounding sections**: Various prepared vegetables, egg, and meat in different colors

The crepes serve as wraps. Diners take one crepe, add fillings of their choice, roll it up, and eat in one or two bites.

## FAQ

### What does gujeolpan taste like?

Each section offers a different flavor and texture—savory beef, earthy mushrooms, fresh vegetables, rich egg. The neutral crepe lets fillings shine. The joy is in combining different elements in each bite.

### Why is gujeolpan considered royal food?

Creating gujeolpan requires significant time, skill, and resources. Each of the eight fillings must be prepared separately with precision. In Joseon times, only the royal court had the staff and ingredients to create such elaborate dishes.

### Can I make gujeolpan without the special platter?

Yes. Arrange components on a large round plate with crepes in the center and fillings around them. The presentation will still be beautiful.

### How long does it take to make?

Plan for 2-3 hours. The crepes take 30 minutes, and each filling requires separate preparation. This is a special occasion dish, not weeknight cooking.

Obangsaek (오방색) refers to the five traditional Korean colors: white, black, blue/green, red, and yellow. Based on Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, these colors represent cosmic balance and holistic health. Korean cuisine, especially royal dishes like gujeolpan, incorporates all five colors.

### Can I substitute ingredients?

Yes, while maintaining color balance. Stone ear mushrooms can be replaced with wood ear mushrooms. Bellflower root can be substituted with daikon. Keep the visual harmony of five colors.

Very. It's mostly vegetables with small amounts of lean protein, cooked with minimal oil. The variety ensures diverse nutrients. In traditional Korean medicine, gujeolpan was considered a "complete" dish.

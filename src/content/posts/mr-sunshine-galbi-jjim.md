## The Drama: A Love Story at Empire's Edge

The year is 1871. A young Korean boy escapes the brutal caste system, stowing away on an American ship. Decades later, he returns—not as a slave's son, but as a United States Marine Corps officer. His name is Eugene Choi, and he's come back to a homeland teetering on the edge of colonization.

*Mr. Sunshine* (미스터 션샤인) premiered on tvN in July 2018 and became one of the most expensive and critically acclaimed Korean dramas ever produced. Written by Kim Eun-sook and directed by Lee Eung-bok, the series weaves a sweeping romance between Eugene Choi (Lee Byung-hun) and Go Ae-sin (Kim Tae-ri), a noblewoman secretly fighting for Korean independence.

Set in the twilight years of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), the drama is a visual feast of hanbok, traditional architecture, and—crucially—the refined cuisine of Korea's aristocratic class. When noble families gather for celebrations, when alliances are forged over dining tables, when love is confessed through shared meals—*galbi-jjim* sits at the center, glistening with caramelized soy and tender enough to fall from the bone.

In a drama about preserving Korean identity against imperial forces, food becomes more than sustenance. It becomes heritage.

## The History of Galbi-Jjim

### What Is Galbi-Jjim?

**Galbi-jjim** (갈비찜) literally translates as:
- **Galbi** (갈비) = Ribs
- **Jjim** (찜) = Steamed/braised dish

Despite the name, galbi-jjim is more braised than steamed. Beef short ribs are slowly cooked in a sweet and savory soy-based sauce until the meat becomes impossibly tender, the collagen melted into silky gelatin, the flavors concentrated into something approaching perfection.

### Origins: From Royal Banquets to Family Tables

Galbi-jjim originated as a dish for special occasions—royal banquets, ancestral rites, and noble celebrations. In the Joseon era that *Mr. Sunshine* depicts, beef was expensive and carefully regulated. Only the wealthy could afford such indulgence.

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897) | Galbi-jjim reserved for nobility and special occasions |
| Japanese Colonial Period (1910-1945) | Traditional recipes preserved despite cultural suppression |
| Post-Korean War (1950s+) | Becomes accessible to middle class |
| Modern Era | Standard dish for holidays and celebrations |
| 2018 | *Mr. Sunshine* rekindles interest in Joseon cuisine |

The dish represents everything the Righteous Army in *Mr. Sunshine* was fighting to preserve—Korean identity, tradition, and the right to their own culture.

### The Art of Jjim Cooking

*Jjim* (찜) refers to a specific Korean cooking technique:

**1. The Marinade**
Unlike Western braising, Korean galbi-jjim begins with a complex marinade. Soy sauce provides the base, but the magic comes from Asian pear (or apple), which contains enzymes that tenderize the meat naturally.

**2. The Low and Slow**
The ribs are braised at low temperature for extended periods. This slow cooking transforms tough connective tissue into succulent gelatin while allowing the sauce to penetrate deep into the meat.

**3. The Reduction**
As the dish nears completion, the cooking liquid reduces into a glossy, concentrated sauce that clings to each rib.

**4. The Presentation**
Traditionally, galbi-jjim is garnished with vegetables cut into decorative shapes—carrots, radish, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, and jujubes—making it as beautiful as it is delicious.

### Why Galbi-Jjim for Celebrations?

In Korean culture, certain foods carry symbolic meaning:

- **Beef short ribs** symbolize prosperity and abundance
- **Chestnuts** represent descendants and fertility
- **Jujubes** signify loyalty
- **The red color** of the finished dish brings good fortune

When noble families in *Mr. Sunshine* gather around a table laden with galbi-jjim, they're not just eating. They're performing an act of cultural identity, a declaration that Korean traditions will endure.

## The Recipe: Galbi-Jjim (Korean Braised Short Ribs)

### Ingredients

**For the Ribs**
- 2 kg beef short ribs, cut into 5-6 cm pieces
- Cold water for soaking

**For the Marinade**
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup rice wine (*cheongju*) or mirin
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey or corn syrup
- 1 Asian pear, grated (or 1 apple + 2 tablespoons pear juice)
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 inch ginger, minced

**Vegetables and Garnishes**
- 2 medium carrots, cut into chunks
- 1 large Korean radish (*mu*), cut into chunks
- 8-10 dried jujubes (*daechu*)
- 12-15 peeled chestnuts (fresh or vacuum-packed)
- 8 ginkgo nuts (optional)
- 10 shiitake mushrooms, halved
- 4 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
- Pine nuts for garnish
- Egg jidan (thinly sliced egg crepe) for garnish

### Equipment
- Large pot or Dutch oven
- Blender or food processor
- Fine mesh strainer
- Heavy-bottomed pan

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Ribs**
Place ribs in cold water and soak for 2-3 hours, changing water every 30 minutes. This removes blood and impurities. For faster results, blanch ribs in boiling water for 5 minutes, then rinse under cold water.

**Step 2: Make the Marinade**
Blend the grated pear, onion, garlic, and ginger until smooth. In a large bowl, combine this puree with soy sauce, water, rice wine, sugar, honey, sesame oil, and black pepper. Mix well until sugar dissolves.

**Step 3: Score the Meat**
Make shallow cuts on the meaty side of each rib. This allows the marinade to penetrate deeper. Add ribs to the marinade, ensuring each piece is coated. Marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.

**Step 4: Braise the Ribs**
Transfer ribs and marinade to a large pot. Add enough water to barely cover the ribs. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming any foam that rises.

**Step 5: Add Vegetables**
After 1 hour, add carrots, radish, chestnuts, and jujubes. Continue simmering for another 30-40 minutes until vegetables are tender and meat is falling off the bone.

**Step 6: Final Reduction**
In the last 15 minutes, add shiitake mushrooms and green onions. Increase heat slightly to reduce the sauce until it becomes glossy and coats the ribs.

**Step 7: Garnish and Serve**
Transfer to a serving platter. Arrange vegetables around the ribs. Garnish with pine nuts and egg jidan strips. Serve immediately with steamed rice.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between galbi-jjim and LA galbi?

*Galbi-jjim* is braised—cooked slowly in liquid until tender. *LA galbi* (also called *LA-style kalbi*) refers to thin-cut flanken short ribs that are marinated and grilled quickly over high heat. The name comes from Los Angeles, where Korean-American butchers developed the cut. Both are delicious, but they're entirely different cooking methods.

### Can I use a pressure cooker or Instant Pot?

Yes. Pressure cooking reduces the braising time from 1.5-2 hours to about 35-45 minutes. However, you'll lose some depth of flavor that develops during long, slow cooking. Many Korean cooks believe traditional stovetop braising produces superior results.

### Why do you soak the ribs in cold water?

Soaking removes blood and impurities, resulting in a cleaner-tasting final dish with less foam during cooking. This step is crucial in Korean meat cookery. The traditional method involves multiple water changes over several hours.

### What if I can't find Asian pear?

You can substitute with a regular apple plus a splash of pear juice, or use kiwi (use sparingly—its enzymes are very powerful). In a pinch, pineapple juice works, though the flavor will be slightly different. The purpose is both flavor and natural meat tenderization.

### How far in advance can I make galbi-jjim?

Galbi-jjim actually improves after sitting. Make it a day ahead, refrigerate, then gently reheat. The flavors deepen and meld. Remove any solidified fat from the surface before reheating. It's perfect for holiday gatherings for this reason.

### What are the decorative egg strips called?

These are *egg jidan* (계란 지단)—thin egg crepes sliced into strips. They're a traditional Korean garnish for celebratory dishes. Yellow (whole egg) and white (egg whites only) versions are often used together. They add color and elegance to the presentation.

### Is this the same as the galbi-jjim at Korean restaurants?

Restaurant versions are often simplified for commercial production. Traditional homemade galbi-jjim—like what would be served in a Joseon noble household—includes more elaborate garnishes (chestnuts, jujubes, ginkgo nuts, pine nuts) and uses higher quality beef. The recipe above is closer to the traditional celebratory version.

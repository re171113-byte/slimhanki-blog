## The Drama: Hunger Before the Horde

Before the dead rise, the living are already dying.

*Kingdom* (킹덤) begins not with monsters, but with famine. In the opening scenes of Netflix's groundbreaking Korean zombie thriller, we see a nation on the brink of collapse. The king lies mysteriously ill. Corrupt officials hoard rice. And in the countryside, starving peasants cluster around meager pots of watery porridge—*juk*—praying for another day of survival.

When Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon) ventures beyond the palace walls, he doesn't discover zombies first. He discovers hunger. He sees what his kingdom has become: a land where a bowl of thin rice porridge is the difference between life and death.

Then the dead start walking. And suddenly, even that porridge becomes impossible to find.

*Kingdom* premiered on Netflix in January 2019, becoming the first Korean original series produced for the streaming giant. Created by Kim Eun-hee and directed by Kim Seong-hun, the series masterfully blends the zombie genre with Joseon Dynasty political intrigue. But at its core, *Kingdom* is about scarcity—of food, of power, of humanity.

In this world, *juk* isn't just breakfast. It's survival itself.

## The History of Juk

### What Is Juk?

**Juk** (죽) is Korea's answer to porridge, congee, and gruel—a category of slow-cooked rice dishes that transform hard grains into silky, comforting sustenance. The word itself is ancient, appearing in Korean texts for over a thousand years.

Unlike Western oatmeal or Chinese congee, Korean *juk* comes in dozens of varieties:

| Type | Korean Name | Main Ingredient |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Plain Rice Porridge | Huinjuk (흰죽) | White rice only |
| Vegetable Porridge | Yachae-juk (야채죽) | Mixed vegetables |
| Pumpkin Porridge | Hobak-juk (호박죽) | Sweet pumpkin |
| Red Bean Porridge | Patjuk (팥죽) | Adzuki beans |
| Chicken Porridge | Dakjuk (닭죽) | Chicken and rice |
| Abalone Porridge | Jeonbok-juk (전복죽) | Abalone and rice |
| Pine Nut Porridge | Jatjuk (잣죽) | Ground pine nuts |

### Origins: Medicine and Survival

*Juk* occupies a unique place in Korean culinary history. It's simultaneously:

**1. Famine Food**
Throughout Korea's history, *juk* stretched limited rice supplies during times of scarcity. One cup of rice could feed one person as steamed rice—or several people as porridge. In *Kingdom*, this is exactly what we see: villages rationing their last grains into watery *juk*.

**2. Medicine**
Traditional Korean medicine prescribes *juk* for the sick and recovering. Its soft texture and easy digestibility make it ideal for those too weak to eat regular food. Specific varieties target specific ailments—pumpkin *juk* for stomach issues, chicken *juk* for colds.

**3. Royal Cuisine**
Paradoxically, the most elaborate *juk* varieties were served in the palace. Abalone *juk*, pine nut *juk*, and other luxury versions featured ingredients commoners could never afford. The same dish could represent poverty or wealth, depending on what went into the pot.

### Juk in the Joseon Dynasty

The *Kingdom* series is set during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), when *juk* played several crucial roles:

| Context | Role of Juk |
|---------|-------------|
| Royal Kitchen | Elaborate versions for royal family's breakfast |
| Medical Treatment | Prescribed by court physicians for ill nobles |
| Famine Relief | Distributed by government during food shortages |
| Everyday Diet | Morning meal for common households |
| Religious Practice | Offered at ancestral rites and temple ceremonies |

The drama's depiction of desperate villagers gathered around communal *juk* pots is historically accurate. During famines, local magistrates were expected to set up *jukso* (죽소)—porridge stations—to prevent mass starvation. Those who failed faced execution.

### Why Juk Matters in Kingdom

In *Kingdom*, food is power. The Haewon Cho clan maintains control by controlling the rice supply. Starving peasants become easy victims—first of political manipulation, then of the plague that turns the dead into monsters.

When Prince Lee Chang shares *juk* with common soldiers, it's a radical political act. When physician Seo-bi (Bae Doona) prepares porridge for the sick, she's fighting the plague with the only weapon she has. And when the zombies finally overrun the *jukso*, the message is clear: even basic survival has become impossible.

## The Recipe: Korean Rice Porridge (Juk)

This recipe creates a simple, nourishing *juk* similar to what Joseon-era Koreans would have eaten. We'll make *yachae-juk* (vegetable porridge) with beef—substantial enough for a meal, humble enough for hard times.

### Ingredients

**For the Porridge Base**
- 1 cup short-grain rice
- 8-10 cups water or stock
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- Salt to taste

**For the Beef and Vegetables**
- 150g ground beef or finely diced beef
- 1 medium carrot, finely diced
- 1 medium zucchini, finely diced
- 3 shiitake mushrooms, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- Pinch of black pepper

**For Serving**
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Sliced green onions
- Additional sesame oil
- Soy sauce for dipping

### Equipment
- Heavy-bottomed pot or Korean stone pot (*ttukbaegi*)
- Wooden spoon
- Ladle

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Rice**
Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours). This helps the rice break down during cooking, creating a creamier porridge.

**Step 2: Season the Beef**
In a small bowl, combine the ground beef with soy sauce, minced garlic, sesame oil, and black pepper. Mix well and let marinate while you prepare other ingredients.

**Step 3: Toast the Rice**
Drain the soaked rice. In your cooking pot, heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil over medium heat. Add the rice and stir constantly for 2-3 minutes. The rice will become slightly translucent and fragrant. This step adds depth of flavor and helps the rice cook evenly.

**Step 4: Cook the Beef**
Push the rice to one side of the pot. Add the seasoned beef to the empty space and cook, breaking it up with your spoon, until no longer pink (about 2-3 minutes). Mix the beef with the rice.

**Step 5: Add Vegetables**
Add the carrot and mushrooms first (they take longer to cook). Stir everything together.

**Step 6: Add Water and Simmer**
Pour in 8 cups of water (or stock for richer flavor). Increase heat to bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30-40 minutes.

**Step 7: Add Zucchini and Finish**
After 30 minutes, add the diced zucchini. Continue cooking for another 10 minutes. The porridge should be creamy and the rice grains soft but not completely dissolved. Add more water if it becomes too thick.

**Step 8: Season and Serve**
Taste and add salt as needed. Ladle into bowls. Top with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and a drizzle of sesame oil. Serve with additional soy sauce on the side.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between juk and congee?

*Juk* is the Korean version of the rice porridge family that includes Chinese congee, Japanese *okayu*, and Vietnamese *cháo*. While all are rice-based, Korean *juk* often features sesame oil, is typically thicker than congee, and comes in a wider variety of flavors (including sweet versions like pumpkin and pine nut).

### How thick should juk be?

Traditional *juk* should be thick enough that a spoon dragged through it leaves a brief trail before closing. It's thicker than soup but thinner than mashed potatoes. If it's too thick, add more water. If too thin, cook longer to reduce.

### Can I make juk with leftover rice?

Yes, though the texture will be different. Leftover rice is already cooked, so it won't break down as much. The result is porridge with more distinct rice grains. Add the leftover rice to boiling water and cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring frequently.

### Why do Koreans eat juk when sick?

*Juk* is easily digestible, gentle on the stomach, and can be made with medicinal ingredients. Its soft texture requires little chewing, and it provides hydration along with nutrition. It's comfort food in the truest sense—food that comforts the body as much as the soul.

### Is plain rice juk (huinjuk) really eaten plain?

Plain white *juk* (흰죽) is traditionally served with side dishes—typically *banchan* like kimchi, seasoned vegetables, and sometimes raw egg yolk stirred in. It's rarely eaten completely plain; the sides provide flavor and variety.

### What makes juk different from rice soup (gukbap)?

*Gukbap* is soup with rice served in it—the rice remains distinct and separate. *Juk* is porridge where the rice has been cooked until it breaks down and thickens the liquid. They're fundamentally different dishes despite both containing rice and liquid.

### How long can I store leftover juk?

Refrigerate leftover *juk* in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The porridge will thicken as it cools—add water when reheating to restore the original consistency. Microwave or reheat on the stovetop, stirring frequently.

## Make It Tonight

In *Kingdom*, the apocalypse doesn't announce itself with sirens or explosions. It creeps in through empty rice stores and hollow stomachs. The monsters come later. The hunger comes first.

There's something profound about cooking *juk* while watching a drama about famine. Each stir of the pot reminds you what food really means—not Instagram aesthetics or Michelin stars, but the basic miracle of having something to eat when you're hungry.

*Juk* is the simplest food in the Korean repertoire. Rice. Water. Heat. Time. From these humble elements, generations of Koreans have created survival, comfort, and even celebration. It's a dish that says: we have enough. We will make it through.

You probably aren't facing a zombie apocalypse. But we all have hard days. And on those days, a bowl of warm *juk*, simply seasoned and slowly made, can feel like the most important meal in the world.

오늘 밤, *킹덤* 정주행하면서 직접 만든 죽과 함께하는 건 어떨까요?

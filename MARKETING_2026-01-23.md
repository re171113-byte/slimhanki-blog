### Business Proposal - Kimchi Jjigae
```
The comfort food that seals the deal 🍲

Kimchi jjigae from Business Proposal - Korea's ultimate soul food.
The bubbling pot of fermented kimchi stew that brings people together.

Why it works:
• Use SOUR kimchi (the older, the better)
• Boil the pork first - don't stir fry
• The fat IS the flavor
• Serve still bubbling

The dish that says "I care about you" without words.

### Our Beloved Summer - Hotteok
```
The taste of winter first love 🥞

Hotteok from Our Beloved Summer - crispy Korean sweet pancakes
with molten brown sugar inside.

Street food that's tied to memories:
• Walking home from school
• First dates in winter markets
• Numb fingers, warm hearts

The dough needs patience. The filling will burn your tongue.
Both are worth it.

### Twenty-Five Twenty-One - Naengmyeon
```
Cold noodles for hot summers and complicated feelings 🍜

Naengmyeon from Twenty-Five Twenty-One - ice-cold buckwheat noodles
in tangy broth that numbs your teeth.

The ritual:
• Scissors to cut the impossibly chewy noodles
• Add mustard (carefully - it's strong)
• Drink the broth from the bowl
• Remember every summer you've ever had

Bittersweet. Like youth itself.

### Strong Woman Do Bong Soon - Dakgalbi
```
Spicy chicken for people with big appetites 🌶️🍗

Chuncheon dakgalbi from Strong Woman Do Bong Soon -
stir-fried chicken that packs a punch, just like Bong Soon.

The secrets:
• Curry powder (yes, really)
• Cook it tableside, hot and loud
• Add cheese around the edges
• Finish with fried rice in the leftover sauce

Bold flavors. No holding back.

**Business Proposal 관련 포스트에:**
```
The food scenes in Business Proposal were so underrated.
Every time they showed kimchi jjigae bubbling I had to
pause and order delivery. There's something about the way
Korean dramas shoot food that makes instant noodles look
like fine dining.
```

**Our Beloved Summer 관련 포스트에:**
```
The hotteok scenes hit different. Something about winter
street food + first love nostalgia = emotional damage.
I tried making it at home and burned my tongue on the
sugar filling. 10/10 authentic experience.
```

**Twenty-Five Twenty-One 관련 포스트에:**
```
The naengmyeon scenes in 2521 were perfect for the vibe.
Cold noodles, cold reality of growing up, cold ending...
(I'm not crying, the mustard got to me)
```

**Strong Woman Do Bong Soon 관련 포스트에:**
```
Park Bo-young eating dakgalbi was basically me every
Friday night. The way she just DEVOURS food in this drama
is so relatable. Made me drive 40 minutes to find a
Korean restaurant that serves cheese dakgalbi.
```

**누군가 김치찌개 만들었을 때:**
```
Looks great! Quick tip - if you want it more restaurant style,
use really sour kimchi. Like, "I forgot this in the back of
the fridge for 2 months" sour. Fresh kimchi doesn't have
the same depth. Also try boiling the pork in the water first
instead of stir-frying - gives you that fatty, rich broth.
```

**누군가 호떡 만들었을 때:**
```
Nice! The filling looks perfect. Did you let the dough rise
long enough? That's usually what makes or breaks hotteok.
Also pro tip: oil your hands really well before shaping,
that dough is sticky as hell.
```

**누군가 냉면 질문할 때:**
```
The key to good naengmyeon is the broth needs to be ICE cold.
Like, painfully cold. I add ice cubes right before serving.
And don't skip the mustard - start with a tiny bit though,
Korean mustard is way stronger than yellow mustard.
```

**누군가 닭갈비 만들었을 때:**
```
Cheese ring around the edge = elite move. One thing that
changed my dakgalbi game: add a tiny bit of curry powder
to the sauce. Sounds weird but it's apparently what some
Chuncheon restaurants do. Adds depth without tasting like curry.

```
the way business proposal made me crave kimchi jjigae
at midnight should be illegal

like it's just fermented cabbage soup why does it look
so comforting when k-drama characters eat it
```

```
our beloved summer understood that hotteok is not just food
it's a core memory

crispy outside, molten sugar inside, burned tongue guaranteed
that's the winter street food experience
```

```
twenty-five twenty-one using naengmyeon as a metaphor
for youth was genius

cold, refreshing, bittersweet, and over too soon
```

```
park bo-young eating dakgalbi in strong woman do bong soon
is the most relatable content ever produced

tiny person. enormous appetite. no apologies.
```

🧵 4 k-drama food scenes that live in my head rent-free
(and what I learned trying to recreate them)

1/ Business Proposal - Kimchi Jjigae

the comfort food that says "I care about you" without words.
learned that you need OLD, SOUR kimchi. fresh kimchi doesn't
work. also don't stir-fry the pork - boil it for that
fatty restaurant-style broth.
```

```
2/ Our Beloved Summer - Hotteok

winter street food that tastes like nostalgia.
the dough needs TIME to rise. the sugar filling WILL burn
your tongue. both are non-negotiable parts of the experience.
```

```
3/ Twenty-Five Twenty-One - Naengmyeon

cold noodles that are basically summer in a bowl.
the broth needs to be painfully cold. scissors are for
cutting the chewy noodles. mustard is mandatory but
start small - korean mustard is aggressive.
```

```
4/ Strong Woman Do Bong Soon - Dakgalbi

spicy chicken for people who eat with their whole personality.
secret ingredient: curry powder (trust me).
finish with fried rice in the leftover sauce or you're
doing it wrong.

what k-drama food scene haunts you?
```

### Business Proposal - Kimchi Jjigae
```
the thing about kimchi jjigae in korean dramas:

it's never fancy. it's always bubbling in a stone pot,
served with too much rice, eaten with people you care about.

in business proposal, every shared meal was a love language.
shin ha-ri didn't need grand gestures. she needed someone
who would eat kimchi jjigae with her at 10pm on a tuesday.

that's the whole point of korean comfort food.
it's not about the recipe. it's about who you're eating with.

#business proposal #kimchi jjigae #kdrama #korean food
#the way to the heart is through the stomach etc
```

### Our Beloved Summer - Hotteok
```
our beloved summer + hotteok + winter = emotional destruction

here's the thing about korean street food in dramas:
it's never just food. it's a timestamp.

hotteok is the taste of being 17.
walking through winter markets.
sharing something warm with someone whose hand you wanted to hold.

the sugar burns your tongue because good memories
are supposed to hurt a little.

#our beloved summer #hotteok #kdrama #choi woo shik
#first love and carbohydrates
```

### Twenty-Five Twenty-One - Naengmyeon
```
naengmyeon in twenty-five twenty-one was perfect casting

cold noodles for a drama about:
- summers that ended too soon
- friendships that couldn't survive adulthood
- love that was real but not forever

the broth is ice cold.
the noodles are impossibly chewy.
you eat it knowing it won't last.

that's youth. that's naengmyeon.
that's why we're all crying over cold noodles.

### Strong Woman Do Bong Soon - Dakgalbi
```
park bo-young eating in strong woman do bong soon
is the representation we needed

tiny woman. superhuman strength. enormous appetite.

the dakgalbi scenes weren't about romance.
they were about a woman who takes up space,
eats without apology, and doesn't shrink herself
for anyone.

that's the real fantasy.

#eat like nobody's watching #kdrama

Question for fellow K-drama food lovers! 🍲

Which of these 4 dishes would you most want to try?

1. Kimchi Jjigae (Business Proposal) - bubbling fermented kimchi stew
2. Hotteok (Our Beloved Summer) - crispy sweet pancakes with molten sugar
3. Naengmyeon (Twenty-Five Twenty-One) - ice-cold buckwheat noodles
4. Dakgalbi (Strong Woman Do Bong Soon) - spicy stir-fried chicken

I've been on a mission to recreate all of these and honestly
dakgalbi was the most fun (cooking it tableside with cheese
is an experience). But kimchi jjigae is the most comforting.

What K-drama food scene made YOU want to cook?
